                    As a dedicated fourth-year student pursuing a B.Sc. in Information and Communication Technology at Mahidol University, with an expected graduation in June 2025, I am eager to apply my strong programming skills and passion for software engineering. I am seeking an opportunity to contribute to innovative projects, leveraging my knowledge of software development, agile methodologies, and quality assurance in both backend and full stack development.
